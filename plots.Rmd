### Numbers of Top 15 Cuisine Restaurants in Manhattan

Using a barplot to indicate the **number** of top 15 restaurants in *Manhattan*.

```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  select(boro, cuisine_description) %>% 
  filter(boro == "MANHATTAN") %>%
  count(cuisine_description, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(15) %>% 
  mutate(cuisine_description = 
           recode(cuisine_description, "Latin (Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, South & Central American)" = "Latin (CDPRSCA)")) %>% 
  mutate(cuisine_description = fct_reorder(cuisine_description, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~cuisine_description, y = ~n, 
          color = ~cuisine_description, type = "bar") %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Numbers of Top 15 Cuisine Restaurants in Manhattan",
    xaxis = list(title = "Cuisine Description"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Number")
  )
```

```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  select(boro, score, cuisine_description) %>% 
  mutate(boro = fct_reorder(boro, score)) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Missing") %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~score, color = ~boro, type = "box",
          colors = "Set2") %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Distribution of Scores in Different Boro",
